Monad Testnet Interaction Guide
Step 1: Set Up Your Computer
Install Python
If Python isn’t installed on your computer, follow these steps to download and install it:

Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Download the latest version (e.g., Python 3.11 or higher).
During installation:
Check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” (important for running Python from the command line).
Select “Install Now”.


After installation, open the Command Prompt (press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter) and type the following to verify:

python --version

Step 2: Create a Folder for Your Project
Run the following commands in the Command Prompt to create a project folder on your Desktop:
cd Desktop
mkdir monad_testnet
cd monad_testnet

Step 3: Install Required Python Libraries
Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
pip install web3>=6.21.0 python-dotenv==1.0.0 colorama==0.4.6 eth-account>=0.13.0 py-solc-x>=2.0.3 tk>=0.1.0

Step 4: Create the Script File

Open Notepad++ (or Notepad if you didn’t install Notepad++).
Copy the entire Python script provided earlier.
Click File > Save As.
Navigate to the monad_testnet folder on your Desktop (e.g., C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\monad_testnet).
Name the file main.py (make sure to include .py at the end).
Click Save.

Step 5: Create the Private Key File
The script requires a file named pvkey.txt containing your wallet’s private key. This is sensitive information, so handle it carefully.

Get Your Private Key: Obtain the private key of your Monad testnet wallet (e.g., from MetaMask or another wallet).
Open Notepad++ (or Notepad).
Paste your private key (e.g., 0x1234...abcd) on the first line.
Press Enter to ensure there’s a blank line after the key.
Save the file:
Click File > Save As.
Navigate to the monad_testnet folder (C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\monad_testnet).
Name the file pvkey.txt.
Set “Save as type” to “All files (.)” in Notepad (not needed in Notepad++).
Click Save.



Step 6: Fund Your Wallet with Testnet MON

Ensure your wallet is funded with testnet MON tokens. You may need to use a Monad testnet faucet or request tokens from the Monad community.

Step 7: Run the Script

Navigate to the Project Folder: In the Command Prompt, ensure you’re in the monad_testnet folder. If not, type:

cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\monad_testnet

Replace YourUsername with your actual Windows username.

Execute the Script: Run the script using:

python main.py

Script Output
After running the script, you’ll see the following interface:

Interact with the Script

The script shows a list of platforms (Apriori, Ambient DEX, etc.).
Type a number (e.g., 1 for Apriori, 6 for Kintsu) and press Enter.
Next, it asks for the number of cycles (how many times to run the action). Type 1 (or another number) and press Enter.
The script will perform actions (e.g., stake, unstake) and show progress with messages like:

➤ stake          | Amount: 0.0423 MON
➤ stake          | Tx: https://testnet.monadexplorer.com/tx/0x...

If You Need Help
If any step fails (e.g., an error during installation, script execution, or funding), let me know the following:

The exact step number.
The error message (copy-paste it).
Your operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac).
If you’re unsure about your wallet, private key, or testnet setup, I can provide more details.
For funding issues, I can search for alternative faucets or guide you through community channels.
